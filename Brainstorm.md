# Brainstorm

## 29th Jan 2017

I wonder if it's possible to set up some form of webhook that works with the hourly updates of _The Undermine Journal_ to push 
notifications in Dicord when desired mats are up at set price or under, or when select items are above a price, for sales.

This could be a very simple addon, but could also be more elaborate. 

  * Notifying the guild when there's under a set amount of needed items in the guild bank.
  * Potential push to text, but focus will be on webhooks (for Discord).
